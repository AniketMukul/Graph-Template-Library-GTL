# Graph Template Library (GTL)

## Overview

GTL is a C++ library that extends the Standard Template Library (STL) to include graph data structures and algorithms. It is designed for high performance and ease of use, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in computer science, engineering, and more.

## Features

- **Graph Data Structures**:
  - Nodes
  - Edges (weighted and unweighted)
- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Topological Sort
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm

## Installation

To install GTL, clone the repository and include the header files in your project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Graph-Template-Library.git
